Power BI Dashboard for R&C Company
This project showcases a Power BI dashboard I created for an imaginary company, "R&C." The dashboard was built using various data modeling techniques and DAX functions to provide meaningful insights.

Key Features:
Data Modeling: I used Power BI's data modeling tools to establish relationships between different tables, ensuring accurate data representation and reporting.
DAX Functions: DAX functions were utilized for calculations and measures, allowing for deeper insights and dynamic data manipulation.
Visualizations: The dashboard includes card visualizations, TOP N filtering, slicers, and conditional formatting to make data more accessible and visually engaging.
